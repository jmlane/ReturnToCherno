# Return to Chernarus

An Arma 3 scenario set in post-apocalyptic Chernarus, 2035 CE.

## About

### Situation

Two weeks ago the country of Chernarus experienced a biological disaster that devastated the population in the northeastern province of South Zagoria. Russian Federation Armed Forces (VSR) have crossed the border and have been assisting the Chernarussian Defense Force (CDF) with humanitarian and stabilization efforts.

There are reports of armed insurrection and rampant violent crime in wake of the disaster. With the borders closed and supplies dwindling, the remaining population has turned on itself, the CDF, and Russian forces, in their bid for survival.

NATO suspects the crisis was caused by a bioweapon of Russian origin, despite the northeastern province being a largely a pro-Russian conclave. This may be the result of a failed weapons test, or it could be a deliberate attempt to destabilize a former Soviet country that allied itself with the West in the last two decades.

### Mission

Your primary objective is to conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations to confirm the source of the disaster.

Your secondary objective is to conduct stability operations to assist the local civilian population where possible.

### Execution

NATO SOF team, call sign AEGIS, will enter South Zagoria undercover, posing as profiteers. Infiltration will occur by sea on the southeastern coast at dawn.

Proceed inland and begin gathering intelligence.

Avoid contact with the CDF and VSR.

Rules of Engagement: you may defend yourself from any imminent threat, however you must account for a high probability of civilians arming themselves in self-defense.
